# Taze Case Study | Dynamic Form App

It is a form application where the fields containing two microservices are determined dynamically. Form microservice runs for `create-form` and `add-form-data` events, and Report microservice runs for `home-list`.

`entity–attribute–value` (EAV) model approach is adopted as the database schema

**.Net Core 8** & **Blazor**

**Api Gateway - Ocelot was used**
```bash
  GET /form & /report
```
